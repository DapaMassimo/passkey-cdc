# Deployment scripts

This folder contains two options for deploying our sample passkey application.

- The first example will allow a developer to deploy the full application from a **macOS or Linux** environment, using bash scripts
- The second example will allow a developer to deploy the full application from a **Windows** environment, using Powershell.

In both cases, the different application components will be deployed to **Docker**.

Navigate into the folder applicable to your environment, and run the **Deploy** script to bring your application online.
